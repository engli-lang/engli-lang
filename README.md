# Engli Language

Engli is a community fork of English with these benefits (among others):
- üí• **0 collisions** &mdash; no words will sound identical, and English words with multiple meanings that differ too much will be split into multiple words
- üß± **Phonetically rigid** &mdash; each letter only has one sound, and the letters surrounding it have no impact on that
- ü§î **0 ambiguity** &mdash; there is only one way to spell any word, and only one way to pronounce it
- üë• **Community-driven** &mdash; syntax and words are decided by community vote
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **0 inconsistency** &mdash; prefixes and suffixes will stay separate from a word, like "multi-player" instead of "multiplayer"
- üåê **International** &mdash; no more divide between "center" and "centre", "sentr" is used instead
- ‚ö° **Faster to type in** &mdash; most words are shorter, which allows you to type faster

It builds upon English, with all its idioms and expressions, but makes changes that improve upon many flaws of the language and aim to make it easier to use, faster to type/speak in, and easier to learn.

## Phonetic Rules

Engli uses the Latin alphabet, just like English. However, unlike English, Engli assigns a single sound to each letter.

Thanks to Engli's phonetic rigidity, once you know the language, you don't need IPA to know how words in it are read. IPA transcriptions can be generated from any Engli word just based on its letters.

| Engli Letter | English Sound |
|--------------|---------------|
| a            | aa            |
| b            | b             |
| c            | th (hard)     |
| d            | d             |
| e            | eh            |
| f            | f             |
| g            | g (not j)     |
| h            | h (exhale)    |
| i            | i             |
| j            | j             |
| k            | k             |
| l            | l             |
| m            | m             |
| n            | n             |
| o            | ah            |
| p            | p             |
| q            | ng            |
| r            | r             |
| s            | s             |
| t            | t             |
| u            | uh            |
| v            | v             |
| w            | oo            |
| x            | sh            |
| y            | ee            |
| z            | z             |

It's important to note that Engli is more than just new phonetic rules. We also change words, add new ones, etc. Simply converting an English word based on the above table will not always lead to the equivalent Engli word.

## Examples

This English:
```md
Hello, how was your day?
```
Becomes this Engli:
```md
Heluw, haw wuz yr dey?
```
The Engli sentence is 2 characters shorter. This isn't much of a difference, but if you type a lot, it'll add up.

The name "Engli" is written "Eqly" within the language. Capitalization behaves the same way as in English at the moment, and can be ignored in informal contexts such as texting.

## Getting Started

We recommend using the [Engli Translator](https://engli-lang.github.io/engli-web/translator) once you've read this page, as it's a great starting point to learn Engli.

You can also try learning the [Phonetic Rules](#phonetic-rules), they're very easy to pick up. You just need to remember basic things, like always reading Engli's `y` letter as English's `ee` sound in words. Over time, this should get easier, until you're able to read Engli words very quickly.

## Is this a serious language?

While we're developing this language for fun, we believe it has many benefits over English.

We know it won't "catch on", but we ask that you imagine this scenario:
- Some people might choose to learn Engli for fun because of the benefits of it &mdash; especially typing speed savings
- Those people can then use it amongst themselves
- Now more people are using the language, giving others more reason to learn it for fun
- Cycle repeats, leading to occasional use of Engli in small communities
